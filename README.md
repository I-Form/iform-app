# Building and starting the `iformapp` service
First you should install docker on your local system: find more details at [https://www.docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started). Once docker is installed, you can create and start the `iformapp` docker image with
```bash
docker compose up
```
`ctrl+c` can be used to stop the service.

# Connecting to the `iformapp` in your web browser
When the docker service is running, navigate to `localhost:8080` in your local web browser.
The username and password are

```bash
username: user
password: secret
```
